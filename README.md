**Hi there 👋**

I'm Jonas, a self-taught programmer with a basic understanding of programming languages like Java and Python, currently on the journey to becoming a professional developer. For the past 2.5 years, I've been responsible for administering a project involving creating, maintaining, and updating my department's SharePoint. This included regulating user access, managing a team for content updates and icon creation, and addressing feedback and feature requests and bugs that may occur.

I've also developed a simple web app for SharePoint using HTML/CSS and JavaScript, providing a changelog and upgrades for it. Alongside my full-time job, I'm enrolled in an online course for an IT Specialist Certification and am deepening my skills with various projects provided by the online college.

🔭 I’m currently working on a Raspberry Pi project for my plants, similar to the curriculum called "FarmBeats for Students" and finishing my online courses.
🌱 I’m currently learning C#, Java, and Python.
⚡ Motto: Every attempt, whether successful or not, provides an opportunity for growth. Persistence is key, but so is adaptability. Remember, if you try something and it doesn't yield the desired outcome, it's an opportunity to learn and adjust. Just like in coding, if the input remains the same, expecting a different output is akin to an infinite loop; it's the changes we make that lead to new outcomes.
🚴‍♂️ Outside of coding, I enjoy cycling, a perfectly brewed cup of coffee, and video games like Diablo and Starcraft.
